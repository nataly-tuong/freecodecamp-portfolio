        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">Lasagna has been around for centuries. It may have started in ancient Rome, but the version we know comes from Naples. Different regions made it their own. Northern Italy used b√©chamel. The South preferred a rich meat sauce. Over time, it became a dish loved around the world.</p>
        <h2>What's inside</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is built in layers. Pasta sheets, sauce, cheese. Each part has a purpose. The top gets golden and crisp in the oven. Making it feels familiar and almost ritual-like.
