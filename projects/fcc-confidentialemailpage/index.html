        The base formula for the Ultimate Lasagna has been updated. Please
        discard version <span class="blurred">3.1.2-RedSauce</span> and replace
        it with the latest <span class="blurred">CrimsonLayerProtocol</span>.
        Failure to comply may result in structural breakdown mid-bake.

        Last night’s mission was a success. Agent Romano extracted
        <span class="blurred">aged buffalo mozzarella</span> from the vault and
        neutralized the decoy noodles using
        <span class="blurred">thermal béchamel dispersion</span>. We've secured
        enough material for Phase 2.

        Our next rendezvous will occur at
        <span class="blurred">Oven Sector 17</span>. Arrive disguised as a
        delivery chef. The passphrase is "<span class="blurred"
          >Layers Within Layers</span
        >." Do not engage unless approached with the secret handshake
        (pat-pat-tap-swipe).
